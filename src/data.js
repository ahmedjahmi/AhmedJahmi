							'A CRUD app attempt at the SoundCloud platform using django, a python framework. Django uses an MVT architectural pattern, Model View Template. Some slight differences, but it is similar to the Model View Controller architectural pattern common in other projects. Users can log in, upload audio and images, create playlists, comment & like. I used the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM and run certain functions asynchronously. The backend uses an sqlite database.'
